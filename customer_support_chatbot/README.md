## 📌 Project Objective

To create an intelligent chatbot that:

* Automates customer support responses
* Understands user queries using NLP
* Reduces human effort in handling repetitive questions
* Works through a simple command-line interface (CLI)

---

## 🚀 Features

* Intent-based chatbot
* NLP text processing using NLTK
* Machine Learning model using Scikit-learn
* Easy to customize responses
* Beginner-friendly and well-structured

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.10**
* **NLTK** – Natural Language Processing
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning
* **Flask** (optional, for future web version)
* **VS Code** – Code Editor
